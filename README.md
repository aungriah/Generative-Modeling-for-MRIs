### Realistic Generation of Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Brain Images with Deep Generative Models

This repository includes the official implemntation for *"Realistic Generation of Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Brain Images with Deep Generative Models"*.

#### Acknowledgements
The code presented in this network is heavily based on [bbeatrix's](https://github.com/bbeatrix/introvae.git) implementation of the "Introspective Variational Autoencoders for Photographic Image Synthesis" and on the [manicman1999](https://github.com/manicman1999/StyleGAN-Keras.git) adaptation of "A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks" to keras.
